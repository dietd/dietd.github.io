# Introduction

For this project, I was tasked with designing an amplifier that needed to meet certain specs using a CMOS 45nm technology node.
The tool for this project was in Cadence. Only the simulation and verification part of designing the op amp was used (i.e. no layout).

In a typical differential amplifier design, there are certain things to look out for, mainly the speed, the error, 
how much power it is using, and how much area on the dye it takes up. These contraints translate into different problems which include:
the slew rate, the gain, the different 3db poles, the phase margin, the sizing of the transistors, etc..

I would eventually solve all these problems and come up with a good topology for the system, along with the sizing for each transistor in the system.

### Overview of Plan

The steps to solve these problems are as follows, first find the static and dynamic error and based on that determine the gain and the unity gain frequency.
Then, place the poles and zeros of the system so that the the transconductance of each stage can deliver maximum gain and can use less power. Then, determine the phase margin and see if it is around 60 degrees.
Lastly, determine the slew rate and output swing.

After these calculations, I used a method for sizing transistors called the Gm/Id method. Essentially, there are terms which are width independent which form a lookup table. From there and by multiplying terms,
you can essentially find the width, given the way you biased the transistors. It is way more accurate than the square model taught in today's electrical engineering classes.
