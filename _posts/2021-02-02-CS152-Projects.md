Here are some projects I worked on during my time in the graduate computer architecture course at Berkeley:

[Branch Predictor](/assets/cs152_lab3)
In this project, I had to recreate the tournament predictor as described in some research literature.
The key takeaway is that branches have patterns and you can use that as input to bias the prediction one way
or another.

Vectorizing Code
In this assignment, I had to vectorize the sparse vector multiplication algorithm by utilizing the RISCV vectorization instructions.

Microcoding
I had to create some microcode that would run on some basic architecture with only one bus and simulate it in Berkeley Chisel.

Cache policy and code
I had to optimize code based on some policies. Overall, my optimization was ranked 3rd in the entire class.
