## About Me

Hi, my name is Diether and I am a student at Berkeley studying computer science.\
I mainly focus on computer systems and design. I also have extensive background in electrical engineering fields, especially circuits design.

Here you can find a list of projects, places I've volunteered/worked, and how to get my resume.
